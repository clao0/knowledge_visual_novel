# Interaction Statement

At the beginning, the only method of interaction is going to the next ‘page’ of the game by pushing the right arrow key. This was explained by adding instructions in brackets.

After this, ‘options’ were introduced where users could explore different story paths. The interface for this (up and down arrows) was also introduced via instructions being placed in brackets for the first option scene.

Keeping the experience engaging was highly important. Therefore, I added in a navigation element where the viewer could choose to go upstairs by hovering the mouse over the side with the stairs on it. Once the stairs image covered the full screen, a battle sequence would start. Whilst there were no instructions for this interaction, as the stairs image suddenly appeared, it is likely the viewer would be curious, hovering the mouse over the image. The image would then move, making interaction method self-explanatory. This also introduced the idea of interactive scenery.

The stairs battle scene was done in an intentionally light-hearted manner (fighting the stairs) so the viewer would intuitively know how to interact with battles later date. Once again, instructions were placed for clarification. Additionally, sound effects and an hp (health points) bar reminiscent of classic RPG games was added to make the experience engaging. This also signified when the stairs were ‘defeated’, allowing them to proceed onto the next scene.

After arriving in the office, the option to search drawers and turn on the tv by hovering the mouse over buttons was introduced. This was hinted at by making the buttons suddenly appear, and telling them to ‘look around’.

Similarly, after reading the lab report or turning on the TV, one could interact with a phone. At this point, I assumed users would be familiar with hover over interaction. Therefore, it is likely that they would conclude one could look at messages/listen to phone calls by hovering over the notifications. I also hinted at this by creating a touch-screen phone interface.

The final ‘new’ form of interaction was shooting the mysterious figure whilst escaping. Hovering over the mysterious figure would cause the figure to ‘die’ triggering a ‘bad’ ending. As with the phone, the method of interaction was made clear by mimicking real-life objects (i.e. by adding the shooting target, as if looking through a gun.)

Though interaction is continued after this, there are no new methods. For instance, when the viewer breaks down the door, it is the same method as the stairs. This is signalled by the ‘hp bar’ indicating one needs to ‘defeat’ it. Other interaction is just using the right arrow for next, and selecting a final option - which have both been present throughout the game.

Finally, a ‘reset’ instruction page was created for when one ‘dies. Lines such as “Be careful who you listen to - words can kill” were used to urge the viewers to think critically about information sources and hint at how to ‘win’. Sound effects/backgrounds were used to increase interest.
